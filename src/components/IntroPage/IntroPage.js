							<p>My name is Isaac and I'm from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berga</a>, a small town in the catalan side of the Pirenees. I have been working as a software engineer in various positions and industries since 2005: from developing a newspaper printing plant simulator to working with <b>web mapping</b> and <b>AR</b> through being a <b>researcher</b> in the <a href="https://www.virvig.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>VR</b> research group</a> at <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UPC</a>, funding my own startup, <b>Alter Sport</b>, and working on different European projects.</p>
							<p>I'm mostly interested in <b>computer graphics</b>, <b>algorithms</b> and <b>web technologies</b> although nowadays I'm also drawn into <b>deep learning</b>.
							<br />If I had to simplify, I would say that I am attracted to everything that presents a <b>challenge</b>. <br />It's this eagerness to challenge myself and to improve that has brought me to learn a vast array of technologies. I'm currently enrolled in a PhD degree focused in 3d city reconstruction from oblique images.</p>
							<p>I also love <b>teaching</b>, something I discovered doing math and physics classes after I graduated, helping <b>others</b> and <b>growing</b>, both professionally and personally, with my teammates. Oh, and if it's not evident enough from the header image, I also love mountains and everything that's commonly associated with them: snow, skiing, hiking, ...</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>On this website, you'll find some of the projects I've been involved with in no concrete order. Don't hesitate to get in touch at isaac(dot)besora(at)gmail(dot)com if you want more information about a project or just want to talk :P</p>
